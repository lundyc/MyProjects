									<h3>The Process</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="clear"> </div>
							</div>
								<p>
								Whitening occurs during the use of our powerful diode light which opens the pores of 
								your teeth and allows them to retract slowly breaking the stains down into smaller 
								molecules, while our formulated gel to begins to whiten them, this guaranteed science is 
								proven to be very effective in whitening teeth.</p>
								
								<p>Generally one session will give the best results possible, however everyoneâ€™s teeth are
								different and if heavy staining is present then the need for a further session may be 
								necessary to achieve best results, remember we will advise you of this in our consultation.
